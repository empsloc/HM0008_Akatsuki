# College Community Connect

Welcome to College Community Connect, a platform for efficient college community management, volunteering recruitment, and meaningful connections.

## Problem Description

The goal is to develop a platform for college clubs and communities to manage their organizations and events, recruit new volunteers, and engage with other communities. The platform aims to provide a seamless way for communities to discover and connect with like-minded volunteers by finding organizations or their interests. Additionally, it should allow volunteers to explore various communities and connect with their preferred community.

## Features

- Club information
- Event timeline
- User authentication
- Community engagement


## Building and deploying in production

If you wanted to run this site in production, you should install modules then build the site with `npm run build` and run it with `npm start`:

    npm install
    npm run build
    npm start

You should run `npm run build` again any time you make changes to the site.

Note: If you are already running a webserver on port 80 (e.g. Macs usually have the Apache webserver running on port 80) you can still start the example in production mode by passing a different port as an Environment Variable when starting (e.g. `PORT=3000 npm start`).
